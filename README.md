This script installs a brand new Ubuntu(12.04) machine, to a deploy ready
server for Ruby on Rails application. It handles all the setup which includes,

```

```
adduser {username} --ingroup sudo (for Ubuntu 12.04)
```

After this all you have to do run the commands below in order to setup your server and deploy your application.

```
